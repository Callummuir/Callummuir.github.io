It is an awesome place, a great scene, better people. But it's 2015, I've been here 6 years. I had left uni and started work as a software engineer where, despite some more great people, I wasn't feeling fulfilled and I wasn't finding time for doing much else. Before Bristol I had only lived in one place, I don't much like the sound of moving only once. So I'm in a job that's not for me, I need more freedom over my own time and I want to get out and see the world. So I do the only reasonable thing: become unemployed and homeless! </p> <br> <p> That's a little melodramatic. I did however cut down my belonging to about two bags worth, and hand in my notice at work and to my landlord. From here I've gone freelance, and started moving around, living in airbnb's and with friends. Were I more pretentious I would call myself a 'digital nomad'. Since I started I've been around the UK a fair bit, mainly going from one social weekend to another, whilst getting some work in during the week. Doing this has taught me a few important lessons: </p> <br> <p> Moving house is still a time/energy drain, even if you only have a pair of bags. For the first few weeks I was moving around around about twice a week. This was mainly down to me trying to get some good feedback on Airbnb, and trying to visit people. This is not conductive to getting anything done. Trying to sort out some sort of routine to work/exercise doesn't work if it's only going to last three days. Add in spending a day packing, travelling and arriving and you get very little done. </p> <br> <p> Libraries are not for quietly working, they are for children to make noise in. Apart from a few notable exceptions (basically any university library) libraries are full of children and children are noisy. Also the internet is average to poor. </p> <br> <p> Atmosphere is everything. I started off staying in and around sleepy English towns, they were a bit cheaper and it would be nice to have a change of scenery I thought. What I didn't bear in mind was how these surroundings affect me. Trying to start a new and hugely different way of living is not best done in a place that is a bit sedate. I didn't really start making the progress I wanted until I landed in London. The feel of the city, and the people I surrounded myself with made all the difference. </p> <br> <p> This is where I am now, starting to live the life I wanted when I made this change and thinking about my next steps. </p> <br> </div> <div class=col-lg-1> </div> <!-- Secondary content - feeds from media --> <div class="secondaryContent col-lg-3"> <h2> </h2> <p></p><br> </div> <div class="col-lg-12 bottomNav"> <footer> <div class="col-lg-8 primaryContent"> </div> <div class=col-lg-1> </div> <div class="col-lg-3 secondaryContent"> <nav> <ul> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=about.html>About</a></li> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=blog.html>Blog</a></li> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=contact.html>Contact</a></li> </ul> </nav> </div> </footer> </div> </div> </div> <!-- Main Body End --> <!-- Scripts Start --> <script type=text/javascript src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=js/main.js></script> <script src=scripts/vendor.baff0332.js></script> <script src=scripts/plugins.19a1d77b.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.8971778a.js></script> <!-- Scripts End -->
