I had a VERY early flight, and arrived having not slept. I got an Uber to my flat, had the hand over and promptly had a nap. The next day kicked off with some pretty heavy rain, with lead to day 2 of not really leaving the flat. Well I did get a bit stir crazy so I left for a brief walk ("That's not really rain, more like a low cloud!") and arrived back soaked through. But the third day was just right. I had a meeting planned to take a look at a co-working space (paperhub.cz/eng/) a stop over on the underground. I really like this place, good office with a good atmosphere, friendly people and fast wifi all at a reasonable price. It's quirk is using bitcoin. The space, and the coffee shop downstairs only accept bitcoin for payment. They have a pretty slick setup for changing cash into bitcoin and have cards set up to their own bitcoin wallet. Just need to sort card payments. </p> <br> <p> I've not actually found my way into the centre yet (saving that for this weekend), but I have had a good explore of the area around the flat. Most exciting moment goes to finding myself on what google maps claimed was a road, but was in fact, a forest, all in my epic quest... to Lidel. With that said, good bread is soo cheap (as is the public transport) and the sausages are delish. </p> <br> <p> Now when I got here I knew precisely no Czech, this lead me to feeling hugely embarrassed when people started talking to me (do I know where the botanical gardens are?). But now I have MVL (minimum viable language): “yes”, “no”, “sorry”, “thanks”, “please” and “do you speak English?” I was surprised to see how much more comfortable I was dealing with people when I could just be polite. </p> <br> <p> My main problem though is that I just don't know anyone, it's not too bad when I'm working in the day. But at the weekends getting a drink with someone would be great. I'm having a look at some meetups and classes that I hope will scratch this itch. I'm also going to go on a walking tour of the town, try to find some places to go and people to know on this. If everything else fails I'm just going to head to an Irish bar! </p> <br> </div> <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-1"> </div> <div class="seperator col-xs-12"> <p>------------------------------x------------------------------</p> </div> </div> <div class="post col-xs-12"> <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-1"> </div> <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-10"> <h2>Project Managing Myself</h2> <p> Over the past couple of months I've been travelling around the UK, visiting friends, going out and having a good time. Whilst being a world class socialite is fun, I was struggling to fit some much needed work in, and to be frank I was getting fed up of sleeping on couches. About a month ago I decided this was going to be a problem, I already felt like unpacking my bag would be a good idea. So I had a little look for places that it might be good to stay for a month or two. Bearing in mind I wanted to be back in the UK for Christmas/New Year, the continent was the obvious choice. After a bit of a look I found an apartment I liked the look of in Prague, and after a bit more looking I found some places that looked good to work in. Magic, found a place to go, all booked up, ready to go in 5 weeks. </p> <br> <p> This was a mistake. Not only is 5 weeks a long time (I've decided my max planning time is down to 3 weeks), but I found the closer I got to actually leaving the less I was willing to commit to things. The old "Oh I'll sort that out after I get there" reared it's ugly head. Situations like this aren’t all bad though. What this really was, was an opportunity to implement some sound working practices. The problem was that I was setting too long a horizon for planning, allowing myself to put things off to a time far off in the future. So I needed shorter period to hold myself accountable to. To do this I adopted a bit of Scrum, and started having weekly 'sprints'. On a Sunday evening assign tasks to be completed that week, then reviewing them on a Friday afternoon to see what got done, what didn't and why (I also do something similar on a daily basis). I find this is lightweight enough to not get in the way, I'm not attributing story points or anything, but I find this is enough planning and reflection to have a positive impact. I do my tracking on a piece of paper, I find this gives it a bit more of a personal feeling, more like having a discussion than just noting things down. Sometimes I even stand up and do it! </p> <br> <p> This works for me tracking my day to day activities, and helps me progress and become more productive with weekly sprints. Obviously it's much more cut down than what I like to use in projects, but when your the only team member and there's no QA it works pretty well! </p> <br> </div> <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-1"> </div> <div class="seperator col-xs-12"> <p>------------------------------x------------------------------</p> </div> </div> <div class="post col-xs-12"> <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-1"> </div> <div class="col-md-6 col-xs-10"> <h2> Start </h2> <p> I first moved to Bristol in 2009 for university. It is an awesome place, a great scene, better people. But it's 2015, I've been here 6 years. I had left uni and started work as a software engineer where, despite some more great people, I wasn't feeling fulfilled and I wasn't finding time for doing much else. Before Bristol I had only lived in one place, I don't much like the sound of moving only once. So I'm in a job that's not for me, I need more freedom over my own time and I want to get out and see the world. So I do the only reasonable thing: become unemployed and homeless! </p> <br> <p> That's a little melodramatic. I did however cut down my belonging to about two bags worth, and hand in my notice at work and to my landlord. From here I've gone freelance, and started moving around, living in airbnb's and with friends. Were I more pretentious I would call myself a 'digital nomad'. Since I started I've been around the UK a fair bit, mainly going from one social weekend to another, whilst getting some work in during the week. Doing this has taught me a few important lessons: </p> <br> <p> Moving house is still a time/energy drain, even if you only have a pair of bags. For the first few weeks I was moving around around about twice a week. This was mainly down to me trying to get some good feedback on Airbnb, and trying to visit people. This is not conductive to getting anything done. Trying to sort out some sort of routine to work/exercise doesn't work if it's only going to last three days. Add in spending a day packing, travelling and arriving and you get very little done. </p> <br> <p> Libraries are not for quietly working, they are for children to make noise in. Apart from a few notable exceptions (basically any university library) libraries are full of children and children are noisy. Also the internet is average to poor. </p> <br> <p> Atmosphere is everything. I started off staying in and around sleepy English towns, they were a bit cheaper and it would be nice to have a change of scenery I thought. What I didn't bear in mind was how these surroundings affect me. Trying to start a new and hugely different way of living is not best done in a place that is a bit sedate. I didn't really start making the progress I wanted until I landed in London. The feel of the city, and the people I surrounded myself with made all the difference. </p> <br> <p> This is where I am now, starting to live the life I wanted when I made this change and thinking about my next steps. </p> <br> </div> <div class="col-md-3 col-xs-1"> </div> <div class="seperator col-xs-12"> <p>------------------------------x------------------------------</p> </div> </div> <div class="nav col-xs-12"> <ul> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=about.html>About</a> &#183; </li> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=blog.html>Blog</a> &#183; </li> <li><a class=hiddenLink href=contact.html>Contact</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> <!-- Main Body End --> <!-- Scripts Start --> <script type=text/javascript src=http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.2/jquery.min.js></script> <script type=text/javascript src=js/main.js></script> <script src=scripts/vendor.baff0332.js></script> <script src=scripts/plugins.19a1d77b.js></script> <script src=scripts/main.8971778a.js></script> <!-- Scripts End --> </div>
